Requirements
For this to execute correctly, you need to make sure your system has the Microsoft Visual C++ 2005 Service Pack installed. This pack was standard in most older systems, but newer systems are no longer bundled with it.

(Note: You will need the x86 pack. It may also help to have the x64 pack as well.)
